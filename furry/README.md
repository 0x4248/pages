# Furry

This page is to educate you on the furry fandom since many people have misconceptions about it.

## What is a furry?

A furry is someone who has an interest in anthropomorphic animals, which are animals that have human characteristics such as walking on two legs, speaking, or wearing clothes. This interest can manifest in various ways, from enjoying art, stories, or movies that feature anthropomorphic animals, like Disney’s Zootopia or the Sonic the Hedgehog series, to creating their own original characters, often called "fursonas." A fursona is a personalized animal character that represents the individual, usually combining human traits with animal characteristics like tails, fur, and animal-like faces.

The furry fandom is the community that brings together people who share this interest. Members of the fandom often engage in creative activities such as drawing, writing, role-playing, and even creating fursuits—costumes that resemble their fursonas or other anthropomorphic animal characters. Many furries enjoy attending conventions and online spaces dedicated to furries, where they can meet like-minded people, share their creations, and express their love for anthropomorphic animals in a supportive environment. Some of the largest furry conventions, such as Anthrocon or Midwest FurFest, attract thousands of attendees each year.

## Common misconceptions about furries

Despite the furry fandom's positive aspects, it has often been misunderstood and misrepresented in popular media and online discussions. Here are some common misconceptions about furries:

### Furries want to be animals

Another common misconception is that furries want to be animals or believe they are animals trapped in human bodies. In reality, furries are aware of the distinction between humans and animals and simply enjoy anthropomorphic animals as a creative outlet or form of self-expression.	

Therians and otherkin are individuals who identify as non-human entities, such as animals or mythical creatures, but they are distinct from furries and represent a separate community with different beliefs and experiences.

### Furries are all LGBTQ+

While many furries identify as LGBTQ+, the fandom is diverse and includes people of all orientations and genders.

### Furries are all sexually deviant or fetishistic

One of the most pervasive misconceptions about furries is that they are all sexually deviant or fetishistic. While some furries may have an interest in adult-oriented content or role-playing, the majority of the fandom is not focused on sexual activities.

### Fursona

A fursona is a personalized animal character that represents an individual within the furry fandom. Fursonas can be based on real-world animals, mythical creatures, or entirely original designs, and they often combine human traits with animal characteristics like tails, fur, and animal-like faces. Some people have multiple fursonas, like me!

### Fursuit

A fursuit is a costume that resembles a fursona or other anthropomorphic animal character. Fursuits are often worn by furries at conventions, meetups, or other events to bring their characters to life and interact with others in the fandom. Fursuits can be partial (covering only part of the body) or full-body suits, and they can be custom-made or purchased from professional fursuit makers.

Fursuits are very expensive and require a lot of care and maintenance to keep them in good condition. They are not a requirement to be a furry, infact there is no requirement to be a furry, just an interest in anthropomorphic animals!

### Conventions

Furry conventions are events that bring together members of the furry fandom to socialize, attend panels and workshops, participate in activities like dances or fursuit parades, and buy or sell furry-themed merchandise. Some of the largest furry conventions, such as Anthrocon or Midwest FurFest, attract thousands of attendees each year.

Many conventions also host charity events raising money for animal-related, environmental, children's, or LGBTQ+ causes.

### Maws and Beans

Maws and beans are terms used within the furry fandom to describe specific features of an anthropomorphic animal character. A "maw" refers to the mouth or jaws of a character, while "beans" are the paw pads on the bottom of an animal's feet. These terms are often used in a playful or affectionate way to describe cute or endearing aspects of a character's design.
