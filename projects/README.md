## Current and future hacking projects
Here are some of the projects I am currently working on or want to work on in the future. A hacking project for me is anything that involves understanding how something works and modifying it to do something it was not intended to do or to improve it.
These projects can range from modifying hardware, software, or even learning to build something from scratch and understanding how it works.

* Plusnet Hub One
* Hardware analysis (Seeming difficult to take apart)
* Also have the hub two to compare

OpenBIOS (Modifying and running in QEMU)
Custom Linux for the Raspberry Pi 4
Custom PI Pico OS
SerneityOS (Building from source and modifying)
TI Nspire CX II (Trying to put Linux on it, in progress but difficult)
