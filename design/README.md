# Design

0x4248 is my online name and I use it for most of my online accounts. The name comes with a design that I use for my profile pictures and for other things (websites, pdf's, etc). This page is a reference for that design.

## Typography

Typography is a very important part of the design.

### Text

Text is written in the font `Noto Sans`. Text can also be written in `Ubuntu` or `Roboto`.

### Heading

All headings are done in `Bai Jamjuree` with a relatively bold weight.

### Code

Code is written in `JetBrains Mono`.

## Colour scheme

0x4248 design uses a dark theme with a simple but effective colour scheme.

- **Background colour (dark):** `#0a0a0a`
- **Background colour (light):** `#1b1b1b`
- **Light gray:** `#aaaaaa`
- **Text colour:** `#f2f2f2`
- **Text colour (darker):** `#e2e2e2`
- **Blue:** `#4a95ec`
- **Blue (darker):** `#3976bc`

Blue colours are used for links, headings and outlines of elements that should being attention. Darker text colours are used for text that is less important such as subheadings and descriptions.

### Other colours

Some other colours are also used such as `#424242` and `#242424` for borders and other elements.

## Logos

### 0x4248

This is the main and original logo of 0x4248. You will see it on things like the bottom of websites and in watermarks. I dont use the 0x4248 logo as a profile picture. I use my fursona (blix) as my profile picture.

### Dots

This logo is used for other things and shows `14` dots in `4` rows. Here is how the logo works:

- The first row has `4` dots
- The second row has `2` dots
- The third row has `4` dots
- The fourth row has `4` dots

There are **4** dots on the first row, then **2** dots on the second row, then **4** dots on the third row and finally **4** dots on the fourth row. The last two rows add up to **8** dots which is the last digit of `0x4248`.

## Names

There are a few names for 0x4248 that are used in different places.

- **0x4248:** The main name.
- **4248** The short name.

The shortened name is used in some places like **4248**theme or **4248**vim.
